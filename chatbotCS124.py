## Currently, the chatbot won't perform sentiment analysis on words that are followed by punctuation, as in "Pitch Perfect 2"  is awesome!

## Currently find move by index is outputting all possible movies because they have the title - end words taken out. So "The Terminator" is returning 5 different terminator movies
